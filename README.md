# 🏦BANK MANAGEMENT PROJECT w/ JAVA

![alt text](/src/Login.png)

The Bank Management System is a Java-based desktop application designed to simulate essential banking operations and manage user accounts securely. It allows users to create new accounts, log in, and perform various banking activities such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks. The system also supports quick transactions, mini statements, and PIN management, making it a complete simulation of basic ATM and banking functionalities.

This project demonstrates strong implementation of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
concepts, **Swing-based GUI design**, and **JDBC-based MySQL connectivity**. It provides a real-world perspective on how financial software systems handle transactions and user data securely.
